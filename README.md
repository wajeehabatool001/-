𝐆𝐥𝐨𝐛𝐚𝐥 𝐀𝐫𝐦𝐬 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬: 𝐖𝐡𝐨 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐟𝐢𝐭𝐬 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐠𝐥𝐨𝐛𝐚𝐥 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐭?


I recently analyzed arms production data from 2019 to 2023 and the insights are alarming.

The arms industry isn’t just about defense; it’s about power, profit, and influence.

S𝒐𝒎𝒆 𝒌𝒆𝒚 𝒇𝒊𝒏𝒅𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒔:
The United States leads the world by far.

➡️18 U.S. companies dominated global arms production.

➡️Year after year, the U.S. consistently tops the charts in revenue from arms sales.

Coming in next: The United Kingdom

➡️5 major arms companies

➡️Billions earned through defense exports, especially to the Middle East and conflict-prone regions.

Then there’s Israel, with 3 top companies in the arms business.

➡️Israel leverages its advanced defense tech, exporting to countries around the world, often marketing its weapons as “battle-tested.”

Arms companies thrive on demand spikes during conflict. Governments subsidize and support these industries. And what emerges is a cycle:

War → Arms Sales → Profits → More R&D → More Arms.
This isn’t just economics, it’s a global issue of ethics and accountability.
